# Configuration Version Management: Apply vs Rollback

## Overview

Configuration version management allows users to manage and restore different configuration states of the system. In version management, there are two core operations: **Apply** and **Rollback**. Although they are similar in technical implementation, they have important differences in business semantics and usage scenarios.

## Apply Operation

### Definition
The apply operation copies the configuration content of the specified historical version and sets it as the currently used configuration.

### Features
- **Purpose**: Reapply a historical version's configuration as the current working configuration
- **Version History**: Does not change the existing configuration version history structure
- **Semantics**: More like "use this configuration", emphasizing configuration content reuse
- **Audit**: Recorded as "apply configuration" in operation logs

### Usage Scenarios
- When you want to reuse the content of a previous specific configuration
- When you need to temporarily switch to a historical configuration for testing
- When you confirm a historical configuration as the best configuration and want to set it as the current configuration

## Rollback Operation

### Definition
The rollback operation fully restores the system configuration to the state of the specified historical version.

### Features
- **Purpose**: Restore system configuration to the state of a specified historical version
- **Version History**: Creates new version records to track this rollback operation
- **Semantics**: Emphasizes "restoring to past state", commonly used in error fixing scenarios
- **Audit**: Recorded as "rollback configuration" in operation logs, with stronger recovery semantics

### Usage Scenarios
- When current configuration has problems and needs to be restored to a previously working version
- When system upgrades introduce compatibility issues that need to be rolled back
- Whenè¯¯operations need to be recovered to the pre-operation state

## Operation Differences Comparison

| Feature | Apply | Rollback |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Main Purpose | Reuse historical configuration content | Restore to historical state |
| Version History Impact | No new version created | Usually creates new version records |
| Business Semantics | "Use this configuration" | "Restore to this state" |
| Typical Scenarios | Configuration reuse, testing | Error fixing, system recovery |
| Audit Record | Apply operation | Rollback operation |

## Best Practices

### When to Use Apply Operation
1. When you want to test the effects of a historical configuration
2. When you confirm a historical configuration as best practice
3. When you need to temporarily switch configurations for comparison

### When to Use Rollback Operation
1. When current configuration causes system anomalies
2. When new configurations introduce problems that need to be resolved
3. When important configurations are accidentally deleted or modified and need recovery

## Important Notes

1. **Current Version Identification**: After operations, the interface automatically updates to show the new current version
2. **Configuration Effectiveness**: New configurations take effect immediately after apply or rollback operations
3. **Irreversibility**: Although other versions can be applied again, the operations themselves are irreversible
4. **Audit Tracking**: All operations are recorded in system logs for tracking and auditing

## Operation Steps

### Applying Configuration Version
1. Find the target version in the version management interface
2. Click the "Apply" button
3. Confirm the operation prompt
4. Wait for the system to apply the configuration
5. The interface automatically refreshes to show the new current version

### Rolling Back Configuration Version
1. Find the target version in the version management interface
2. Click the "Rollback" button
3. Confirm the operation prompt
4. Wait for the system to rollback the configuration
5. The interface automatically refreshes to show the new current version

By understanding these differences, you can more effectively use the configuration version management feature to ensure the correctness and traceability of system configurations.
