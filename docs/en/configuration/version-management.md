# Configuration Version Management: Apply

## Overview

The configuration version management feature allows users to manage and restore different configuration states of the
system.

## Apply Operation

### Definition

The **Apply** operation copies the content of a specified historical version and sets it as the currently active
configuration.

### Characteristics

- **Purpose**: Re-apply a previous configuration version as the current working configuration
- **Version History**: Does not alter the existing configuration version history structure
- **Semantics**: More like “use this configuration,” emphasizing content reuse
- **Audit**: Logged as “Apply Configuration” in the operation log

### Use Cases

- When you want to reuse the content of a specific previous configuration
- When you need to temporarily switch to a historical configuration for testing
- When you have confirmed that a historical configuration is optimal and should become the current one

## Best Practices
